#Hayden Merrill

I'm a CS student at Colby College. I'm taking CS321: Software Engineering this semester.
I'll be doing several projects in a group with my classmates.

On my own time, I'll be exploring web development with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
In addition to computer science, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons and reading.
